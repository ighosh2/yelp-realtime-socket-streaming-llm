**PROJECT NAME:**

Real-time Socket Streaming and Sentiment Analysis Using Yelp Customer Data and LLM 

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**REPO NAME:**

yelp-realtime-socket-streaming

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**ABSTRACT OF PROJECT:**

This project serves as a comprehensive guide to building an end-to-end data engineering pipeline
using TCP/IP Socket, Apache Spark, OpenAI's GPT-3.5 Turbo APi, Kafka, and Elasticsearch. The project covers 
each stage from data acquisition, processing, and sentiment analysis with ChatGPT, to production 
in Kafka topics and connection to Elasticsearch. The dataset used is Yelp customer reviews,
which allows for real-time analysis and visualization of user feedback. This project
demonstrates the seamless integration of these technologies to handle real-time data streaming and analytics.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**WHAT ARE WE TRYING TO SOLVE:**

The project aims to solve the challenge of real-time data streaming and processing, particularly
focusing on:


Efficient data transfer over TCP/IP socket connections.
Real-time sentiment analysis of Yelp customer reviews using advanced language models.
Streaming data to Kafka for scalable and reliable processing.
Replicating and indexing data in Elasticsearch for fast search and visualization.
Handling large datasets in GBs and TBs by using batch processing via a web socket to send data
to the Spark system in batches for efficient processing and indexing.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**USE CASES WHICH CAN BENEFIT ON IMPLEMENTATION IN ORGANIZATIONS:**

Real-time Sentiment Analysis:

Organizations can analyze Yelp customer reviews in real-time to gauge public sentiment and
respond promptly.

Live Monitoring and Alerting:

Businesses can implement real-time monitoring systems to track customer feedback and generate 
alerts based on sentiment trends or specific keywords.

Data-Driven Decision Making:

Real-time data analytics can empower organizations to make informed decisions quickly, based
on the latest customer reviews and feedback.

Enhanced Search Capabilities:

By indexing Yelp reviews in Elasticsearch, organizations can provide fast and relevant search
capabilities for customer feedback analysis.

Streaming Data Pipelines:

Use cases that require continuous data flow and processing, such as monitoring customer 
sentiment or analyzing trends in customer feedback, can benefit from this pipeline.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**LIBRARIES USED AND WHY:**

OpenAI:

Reason: For advanced sentiment analysis and natural language processing tasks, leveraging
the capabilities of GPT-4 for understanding and analyzing text data from Yelp reviews.

PySpark:

Reason: To handle large-scale data processing and real-time analytics, providing a robust 
framework for distributed data processing.

confluent_kafka:

Reason: For integrating with Kafka to build real-time data pipelines, ensuring 
high-throughput, fault-tolerant, and scalable data streaming.

fastavro:
Reason: To serialize and deserialize data efficiently in Avro format, enabling compact 
and fast data exchange between different components of the pipeline.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**TECHNOLOGY USED AND WHY:**

TCP/IP Socket:
Reason: To transfer data efficiently over network connections, enabling real-time data acquisition 
from various sources.

Apache Spark:
Reason: For distributed data processing and real-time analytics, ensuring the system can handle 
large volumes of data efficiently.

OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo (LLM Component):

Reason: For performing sentiment analysis and other natural language processing tasks, providing
deep insights from Yelp review data.

Kafka:

Reason: To stream data reliably and at scale, ensuring that data flows smoothly through the pipeline
from acquisition to storage.

Elasticsearch:

Reason: For replicating and indexing data, allowing for fast search and real-time visualization
of large datasets.

**Future Scope of Work:**

As a potential future scope , an integration of the a reporting tool like Tableau/Power BI will
be done  This will end the end client/stakeholder to have an understanding
of the system without delving deep into the tech side. Hence can take logical decisions 
based on the graphical view / mapping of the system in place

Integrating Tableau with the project can provide significant benefits for clients and stakeholders
by transforming raw data into actionable insights through interactive dashboards and visualizations. 
Here’s how Tableau can be leveraged:

Interactive Dashboards:

Create dynamic and interactive dashboards that allow clients to explore the sentiment analysis results of 
Yelp customer reviews in real-time. Users can drill down into specific details and filter data based on various
parameters such as time range, location, or specific keywords.

Real-time Data Visualization:

Connect Tableau directly to the Elasticsearch index to visualize the real-time data streaming into the system. 
This enables stakeholders to monitor live updates and trends as new customer reviews are processed.
Sentiment Trends Analysis:

Visualize sentiment trends over time to identify patterns and shifts in customer opinions.
This can help businesses understand the impact of their actions on customer sentiment and make timely adjustments.

Geospatial Analysis:

Use Tableau’s mapping capabilities to visualize the geographical distribution of 
customer reviews and sentiments. This can help identify regional trends and preferences.
Performance Metrics:

Track key performance metrics such as the volume of reviews processed, sentiment scores,
and response times. This can provide insights into the efficiency of the data pipeline and 
the overall health of the system.

Customizable Reports:

Generate customizable reports that can be shared with different departments within the organization.
These reports can include insights tailored to the specific needs of marketing, customer service,
product development, and other teams.

Alerting and Notifications:

Set up alerts and notifications within Tableau to inform stakeholders about significant changes
in sentiment or other important metrics. This ensures that key decision-makers are always aware of
critical insights as they happen.
